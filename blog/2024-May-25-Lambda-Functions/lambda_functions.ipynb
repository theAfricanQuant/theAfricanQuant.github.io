    "## **Introduction**\n",
    "\n",
    "In programming, you often find yourself repeating the same logic multiple times. When this happens, it's usually a good idea to use a function. Functions allow us to encapsulate commonly or repeatedly executed tasks, so instead of writing the same code over and over, we can simply call a function with different inputs, thereby reusing the code efficiently.\n",
    "\n",
    "Before diving into lambda functions, let's first understand regular functions.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Regular Functions**\n",
    "\n",
    "In Python, a function is defined using the `def` keyword, followed by the function name and parentheses `()`, which may include parameters, a body of code to be executed, and a `return` statement that specifies the value to be returned. The general syntax is:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def function_name(parameters):\n",
    "    # function body\n",
    "    return output\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "For instance, suppose you frequently need to sum two values in your code. You could write a function to handle this task:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def add_values(value1, value2):\n",
    "    return value1 + value2\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The function `add_values` takes two arguments, `value1` and `value2`, and returns their sum. Here's a breakdown of how the function works:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Function Definition**:\n",
    "    ```python\n",
    "    def add_values(value1, value2):\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "    - The function `add_values` is defined with two parameters: `value1` and `value2`.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Summing the Values**:\n",
    "    ```python\n",
    "    return value1 + value2\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "    - The function returns the result of adding `value1` and `value2`.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Here is an example of how you might use this function:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "result = add_values(3, 5)\n",
    "print(result)  # Output: 8\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "When the function `add_values` is called with the arguments `3` and `5`, it computes and returns their sum, which is `8`.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "In `add_values`, the function name is `add_values`, and it takes two parameters: `value1` and `value2`.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Parameters and Arguments\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Parameters** are variables listed inside the parentheses in the function definition.\n",
    "- **Arguments** are the values that you pass into the function when you call it.\n",
    "\n",
    "In `add_values`, `value1` and `value2` are parameters, and when you call the function like `add_values(3, 5)`, `3` and `5` are the arguments.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Return Statement\n",
    "\n",
    "The `return` statement ends the function execution and specifies what value should be returned to the caller:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "return value1 + value2\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The function returns the sum of `value1` and `value2`.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Lambda Functions**\n",
    "\n",
    "Lambda functions, also known as anonymous functions, are a shorter way to write functions in Python. They are defined using the `lambda` keyword instead of `def`. These functions are quick, simple, and used for short-term tasks. They are particularly useful in scenarios where a full function definition would be overkill.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here is how you can write the same `add_values` function using a lambda function:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# regular function\n",
    "def add_values(value1, value2): return value1 + value2\n",
    "\n",
    "# lambda function\n",
    "add_values = lambda value1, value2: value1 + value2\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Both the regular function and the lambda function accomplish the same task: summing any two numbers passed to them. The main differences are that lambda functions use the `lambda` keyword, do not have a name (unless assigned to a variable like we did above), and do not require a `return` statementâ€”the result is implicitly returned.\n",
    "\n",
    "Regular functions and lambda functions each have their own use cases. Regular functions are more versatile and easier to read, especially for complex operations. Lambda functions are more concise and are often used for short-term tasks and in places where a small function is required temporarily, such as in method chaining or as arguments to higher-order functions.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this article, we will focus on how lambda functions can be utilized effectively in your code, particularly in the context of method chaining in pandas."

    "### **Chaining in pandas**\n",
    "\n",
    "In pandas, chaining methods is often preferred over using operators for manipulating data because it enhances readability and maintains a functional style. Since most pandas methods return a new object rather than modifying the original data in place, you can continuously chain method calls on the returned objects. This approach leads to cleaner and more understandable code. Although chaining with operators is possible, it usually requires wrapping operations in parentheses.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Methods and Functions**\n",
    "\n",
    "Methods and functions serve similar purposes in programming. Both encapsulate reusable blocks of code, but methods are functions that belong to objects, allowing them to operate on the data contained within those objects. Functions, on the other hand, are standalone units that can be called independently.\n",
    "\n",
    "## A Deeper dive\n",
    "\n",
    "What we are going to do here is to play around with a couple of datasets and deploy what w have been talking about in code.\n",
    "\n",
    "We have a stock data we created (also called syntehtic data) and we will take the time to prepare it. First we will load it with pandas and display its information.\n",

    "\r\n",
    "To handle this situation effectively, we will adopt a step-by-step approach. The initial step involves converting the `Date` column from its current `object` type to a `Datetime` type.

    "Method chaining offers several benefits: it allows for multiple operations in a single, compact statement, making the code concise, and for those familiar with the technique, it enhances readability by presenting a clear, linear sequence of transformations. It promotes a functional programming style, where each method call is a transformation, avoiding the need for intermediate variables and reducing the risk of variable conflicts and cognitive load. Developers who prefer method chaining appreciate its efficiency in expressing multiple operations in one line, providing a streamlined coding experience with consistent and intuitive flow, and less boilerplate code, making the codebase cleaner and easier to maintain. \n",
    "\n",
    "However, the step-by-step approach may be preferred by beginners or those less familiar with method chaining, as it breaks down each operation into distinct steps that are easier to follow and debug. This approach also provides explicitness, making each line of code clear, which can be beneficial for readability and maintenance, especially in complex transformations. Ultimately, method chaining is favored for its concise, readable, and functional approach, while the step-by-step method is valued for its clarity and ease of understanding, particularly for beginners and debugging purposes. The choice between the two depends on the developer's familiarity with the techniques and the specific context of the code."

    "## **Conclusion**\n",
    "\n",
    "Lambda functions, or anonymous functions, are a powerful feature in Python that allow for creating small, unnamed functions at runtime. Their concise syntax makes them ideal for scenarios where a simple function is needed temporarily. Beyond their use in data aggregation with pandas, lambda functions are widely utilized in various contexts to enhance code efficiency and readability.\n",
    "\n",
    "They are frequently used in sorting operations to define custom sort keys, in filtering sequences to specify conditions, and in mapping functions to apply transformations to elements. Lambda functions also shine in reduction operations to cumulatively apply functions to sequences, and in functional programming for composing and combining functions on the fly. Additionally, they are valuable in defining inline callbacks in event-driven programming, like GUI development.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you haven't used lambda functions before, this could be an excellent opportunity to explore and incorporate them into your programming practice. Their flexibility and brevity can streamline your code and open up new possibilities for concise and efficient function definitions\n",
